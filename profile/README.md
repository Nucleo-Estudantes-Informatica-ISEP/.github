# 🎯 Mission

As the informatics department of NEI, our mission is clear: we are responsible for providing support for any informatics related issues, all the way from website development, to server, e-mail and drive management. We are committed to allow the day-to-day operations of each department to run smoothly and to share the organization events through our work.

# 📋 Responsibilities

The Informatics department of NEI is responsible for developing and maintaining projects for the events organized (FallStack, GameJam) by NEI-ISEP (e.g. websites, discord bots, etc.), as well as maintaining the platforms and services used by NEI (e.g. E-mail accounts, Zoom sessions, etc.).

# 🧱 Structure

The department, similarly to the others, is composed by a head/coordinator and the rest of the members. It’s worth noting that each member may be assigned to different projects, depending on their aptitudes and skills, as well as the areas that they may be most interested in (e.g. back-end, front-end, discord bots, etc.).

**Currently**, the department is composed by the following members:

# 💻 Projects

### 🧾 Policy

We keep the exclusivity of our event repositories content and details to the organization for practical purposes, as some key information about partners can me shared throughout the development and needs to be checked before being made public. Therefore, we keep the repositories of the current event private until the respective event is successfully finished.

This policy safeguards the integrity of our events, prevents premature dissemination of information and unauthorized access that could compromise the entire event.

## 👨🏻‍💻 FallStack

FallStack stands as a recurring highlight within our organization, serving as door to the Job World. Many companies come to this event to share possible internships and future job offers to the ISEP students.

## 👾 Game Jam

Game Jam is an event dedicated to all game developers who want to test their knowledge in two intense days in a hackathon style contest. The students can sign up to the event and compete for the best game. Aswell as the final prize for the winners, the fun is always grated.

## ⚡ NEI Website

Initially, our website was made on WordPress. A simple and efetive way to show our purpose, members and some quick links. 

However, we decided, in 2022, to step up and rebuild it using NEXT.js. The decision to migrate to the relatively new NEXT.js framework reflects our commitment to expanding our knowledge horizons and delivering an even more captivating user experience, opening doors for new things to come! 

We are currently developing the **new** website but you can still check our website!

# 🚀 Technologies Utilized

## Static Websites with Astro

For creating incredibly fast static websites, we turn to Astro. It's a dynamic static site generator that allows us to use modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte. Astro takes care of turning these frameworks into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during the build process.

## Dynamic Websites with Next.js

When our websites need to be dynamic and interactive, we rely on NEXT.js. This framework combines server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side rendering to provide a versatile solution. NEXT.js enables us to build applications that fetch data in real-time and offer features like user authentication and live updates.

## Examples 

Purpose | Technologies | Example Project |
--------| ------------- |------------------
Static Websites | Astro | [Gamejam Event](https://gamejam.nei-isep.org/)
Dynamic Websites | NEXT | [NEI Website](in progress)
