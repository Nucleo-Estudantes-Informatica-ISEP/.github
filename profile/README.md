# About Us

A short overview of the informatics department is presented, all the way from the team’s mission and responsibilities to its structure and current members.

# 1. Mission

As the informatics department of NEI, we are responsible for providing support for any informatics related issues, all the way from website development to server, e-mail and drive management, allowing the day-to-day operations of each department to run smoothly and for people to be inspired and attracted to NEI’s events through our work.

# 2. Responsibilities

The Informatics department of NEI is responsible for developing and maintaining projects for the events organized by NEI-ISEP (e.g. websites, discord bots, etc.), as well as maintaining the platforms and services used by NEI (e.g. E-mail accounts, Zoom sessions, etc.).

# 3. Structure

The department, similarly to the others, is composed by a head/coordinator and the rest of the members. It’s worth noting that each member may be assigned to different projects, depending on their aptitudes and skills, as well as the areas that they may be most interested in (e.g. back-end, front-end, discord bots, etc.).

**Currently**, the department is composed by the following members:
